# Blackjack

## A contemporary take on blackjack

Here are all the rules: 

* The cards have the same number of points as their values (indepedent of the suit).
* A (ace) has value 1, on the other hand, K (king), Q (queen) and J (jack) have value 10.
* Each GAMBLER (user), as well as the DEALER (software), begin with two cards.
* There is a 'Hit or Stand' option for every additional card.
* If you hit, you get one more card and it goes on until: you stop (stand), lose (bust) or win (blackjack).
* The goal is to get the maximum score in the table, with the upper limite of 21, 22+ points and you bust.
* At the end, the player with maximum score wins, however a tie can also occur.

Obs. This game is runnable on Windows OS only.
